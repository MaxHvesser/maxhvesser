### Hi there, I'm Max ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Android Developer from the UK, currently working in Norway at FINN.no. I'm passionate about Android and have been using Android since Jelly Bean. I am a talented, experienced problem solver and developer, with a user-experienced-based focus, enjoying creating the best UX experience I can.

I have a strong Computer Science background that affords me the ability to work with a plethora of languages and allows me to adapt to unfamiliar and new environments. I love open source projects and enjoy contributing to mine and others' projects.
